Sure! Below is the updated Python script that connects to both PostgreSQL and Redis containers running in the same pod and retrieves the desired information. The script collects information about the PostgreSQL database name, version, and uptime, as well as the Redis server version and uptime. It then stores all this information into a single JSON file named `database_info.json` in the `/tmp/` directory.

Make sure you have the required libraries installed by running:

```bash
pip install pymongo psycopg2-binary redis
```

Here's the updated Python script:

```python
import os
import json
import pymongo
from pymongo import MongoClient
import psycopg2
import redis
from datetime import datetime, timezone

# MongoDB Configurations
mongo_username = 'your_mongo_username'
mongo_password = 'your_mongo_password'
mongo_port = 27017
mongo_connection_string = f"mongodb://{mongo_username}:{mongo_password}@localhost:{mongo_port}/"

# PostgreSQL Configurations
pg_username = 'your_pg_username'
pg_password = 'your_pg_password'
pg_port = 5432
pg_connection_string = f"postgresql://{pg_username}:{pg_password}@localhost:{pg_port}/"

# Redis Configurations
redis_port = 6379
redis_connection = redis.StrictRedis(host='localhost', port=redis_port, decode_responses=True)

# Collect MongoDB information
mongo_client = MongoClient(mongo_connection_string)
mongo_server_info = mongo_client.server_info()
mongo_info = {
    "database_name": mongo_server_info["db"],
    "database_version": mongo_server_info["version"],
    "is_master": mongo_server_info["ismaster"],
    "time_since_up": str(datetime.now(timezone.utc) - mongo_server_info["uptimeEstimate"]),
}
mongo_client.close()

# Collect PostgreSQL information
pg_conn = psycopg2.connect(pg_connection_string)
pg_cursor = pg_conn.cursor()
pg_cursor.execute("SELECT current_database(), version();")
pg_database_name, pg_version = pg_cursor.fetchone()
pg_cursor.close()
pg_conn.close()

pg_info = {
    "database_name": pg_database_name,
    "database_version": pg_version,
    "time_since_up": str(datetime.now(timezone.utc) - datetime.fromtimestamp(redis_connection.info()['uptime_in_seconds'], timezone.utc))
}

# Collect Redis information
redis_info = {
    "redis_version": redis_connection.info()['redis_version'],
    "time_since_up": str(datetime.now(timezone.utc) - datetime.fromtimestamp(redis_connection.info()['uptime_in_seconds'], timezone.utc))
}

# Save the collected information to a JSON file
output_file_path = "/tmp/database_info.json"
database_info = {
    "mongodb": mongo_info,
    "postgresql": pg_info,
    "redis": redis_info
}

with open(output_file_path, "w") as output_file:
    json.dump(database_info, output_file, indent=4)

print("Database information has been collected and saved to:", output_file_path)
```

Save this script as, for example, `database_info.py`, and run it in the sidecar container within the same pod as the MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and Redis containers. The script will connect to each database, collect the desired information, and store it as a JSON file named `database_info.json` in the `/tmp/` directory.

Make sure to replace `your_mongo_username`, `your_mongo_password`, `your_pg_username`, and `your_pg_password` with the actual credentials for MongoDB and PostgreSQL. Additionally, ensure that the sidecar container has access to the `/tmp/` directory for saving the JSON file. Adjust the script accordingly if your databases are running on different hosts or ports.

To retrieve a list of databases along with their sizes and creation date/time from PostgreSQL using `psycopg2`, you can execute additional queries on the `pg_database` and `pg_stat_file` system catalogs. The `pg_database` catalog contains information about each database, including the database name and creation date. The `pg_stat_file` catalog can be used to get the size of the database files.

Here's the modified code to achieve this:

```python
import os
import psycopg2
import json
from datetime import datetime

# Replace these with your actual credentials and connection details
pg_username = 'your_pg_username'
pg_password = 'your_pg_password'
pg_host = 'localhost'
pg_port = 5432  # Replace this with your PostgreSQL port if it's different from the default (5432)

# Connect to the default PostgreSQL database ('postgres')
default_db_connection_string = f"postgresql://{pg_username}:{pg_password}@{pg_host}:{pg_port}/postgres"
default_db_conn = psycopg2.connect(default_db_connection_string)
default_db_cursor = default_db_conn.cursor()

# Query the list of databases
default_db_cursor.execute("SELECT datname, pg_database_size(oid) FROM pg_database;")
database_list = default_db_cursor.fetchall()

# Close the cursor and connection to the default database
default_db_cursor.close()
default_db_conn.close()

# Create a list to store database information
databases_info = []

# Connect to the selected database and get creation date
for database_info in database_list:
    db_name = database_info[0]
    db_size = database_info[1]

    selected_db_connection_string = f"postgresql://{pg_username}:{pg_password}@{pg_host}:{pg_port}/{db_name}"
    selected_db_conn = psycopg2.connect(selected_db_connection_string)
    selected_db_cursor = selected_db_conn.cursor()

    selected_db_cursor.execute(f"SELECT pg_stat_file('base/{oid}') FROM pg_database WHERE datname = '{db_name}';")
    db_creation_time = selected_db_cursor.fetchone()[0]
    db_creation_time = datetime.fromtimestamp(db_creation_time)

    selected_db_cursor.close()
    selected_db_conn.close()

    # Append the database info to the list
    databases_info.append({
        "database_name": db_name,
        "size_bytes": db_size,
        "creation_date": db_creation_time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
    })

# Save the collected information to a JSON file
output_file_path = "/tmp/database_info.json"
with open(output_file_path, "w") as output_file:
    json.dump(databases_info, output_file, indent=4)

print("Database information has been collected and saved to:", output_file_path)
```

In this modified code, we retrieve the database name and size using the query `SELECT datname, pg_database_size(oid) FROM pg_database;`. We then iterate through each database, connect to it, and retrieve its creation time using `pg_stat_file('base/{oid}')`.

The collected information is stored in a list of dictionaries called `databases_info`. Each dictionary contains the database name, size in bytes, and creation date/time. Finally, the entire list is saved to a JSON file named `database_info.json` in the `/tmp/` directory.

Please note that the creation date is based on the file's creation time, which corresponds to the time the database files were created on the disk. It's not the same as the creation time recorded by PostgreSQL itself, as PostgreSQL doesn't track the database's creation time explicitly.
